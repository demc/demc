              <h3>Future Thinker</h3>
              <p>
                I spend a lot of time thinking about the future.
                Often I am so preoccupied with the future that its as though I am not present in the moment.
                Imagining many possile futures for myself fuels my motivation to work hard today to have a better tomorrow.
              </p>
              <p>
                I deploy this strength every day as an educator.
                Designing lessons and projects requires substantial time dedicated toward thinking about the future.
                Our curriculum originates from a vision I conceive about what skills and knowledge I hope students will obtain.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am filled with energy, hope, and determination when I am contributing to a significant cause or idea.
                Likewise, I have found myself feeling despondent when the my work is frivolous in nature.
                My affinity for educating youth comes from my desire to contribute something significant.
              </p>
              How I can use this strength:
              <ul>
                <li>Planning and creating a vision.</li>
                <li>Building things that matter.</li>
                <li>Helping people believe in an idea.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Discoverer</h3>
              <p>
                I love learning and thinking.
                Being curious, asking questions, and demanding answers leads to surprising outcomes.
                How does the world work?
                Why are things the way they are?
                What new ideas will change the world?
              </p>
              <p>
                I want to undestand things deeply.
                And I don't believe in easy answers.
                This means that knowledge and understanding must be built first-hand: through personal struggle and determination.
                There is substantial merit in doing things purely for the rigor - intellectual or physical.
                These experiences make me more resilient and help me acquire better understanding of myself and the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                Learning about new concepts is one of the most satisfying activities in my life.
                The feeling of serenity and assuredness after tackling a difficult problem is unique to the endeavour.
              </p>
              How I can use this strength:
              <ul>
                <li>Constantly building my own knowledge.</li>
                <li>Asking salient questions to others.</li>
                <li>Forming better understanding by having constrasting experiences.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
